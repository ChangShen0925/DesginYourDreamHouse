class AudioProcessor:
    """
    A class that controls the process of recording audio
    from the device's microphone, transcribing it into text
    using the Whisper ASR model, and publishing the transcriptions to a
    ROS topic. 
    
    The recording is performed in chunks of a specified duration
    (default 7 seconds). After each chunk is recorded, it is processed
    and the resulting transcription is published to the '/speech_rec'
    ROS topic if it's non-empty and unchanged from the previous chunk's
    transcription. 
    
    This class is designed to work in conjunction with a 'StateManager'
    which subscribes to the '/speech_rec' ROS topic and uses the
    incoming transcriptions to guide the robot's states.
    
    Attributes:
    - language: The language expected in the audio to be transcribed.
    - audio_channel: Channel to record audio.
    - sampling_freq: Sample rate for audio (Hz).
    - record_file: Path to the file where the recorded audio is saved.
    - speech_transcriber: An instance of the SpeechTranscriber class
                          for audio transcription.
    - transcription: The transcription of the latest chunk of audio.
    - prev_transcription: The transcription of the previous chunk of
                          audio.
    - is_recording: A boolean indicating whether the audio recording
                    is currently active.
    - stop_process: A boolean indicating whether to stop the
                    recording-transcribing process.
    - chunk_duration: The duration of each chunk of audio to be
                      recorded (in seconds).
    - transcription_publisher: A ROS Publisher object for publishing
                               the transcriptions to a ROS topic.
